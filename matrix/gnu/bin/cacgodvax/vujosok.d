/** 
Here's a thinking process to arrive at the D code and explanation:

1. **Understand the Goal (from the R code's *name*):**
    *   The R code had `x <- c(x1 = 1.2, x2 = 2.0, x3 = 3.2)` commented 
    as "# filter servers link count static reference".
    *   The D function signature is `filterServersLinkCountStaticReference(T[] x, T[] y)`.
    *   The R code *body* for this "filter" idea was `x <- c(...)`, which isn't a filter 
    operation but an assignment.
    *   The D *body* is `return filter!(a => a != x && a != cast(double)x)(x);`. 
    This *is* a filter operation.

/** 
3. **Analyze the D Function Body:**
    *   `return filter!(a => a != x && a != cast(double)x)(x);`
    *   `filter!(lambda)(collection)`: This is standard D 
    `std.algorithm.filtering.filter`.
    *   `collection` is `x` (the first input array).
    *   `lambda` is `a => a != x && a != cast(double)x`.
        *   `a`: This is an *element* from the array `x` being 
        iterated over by `filter`. So, `a` is of type `T`.
        *   `a != x`: This is comparing an element `a` (type `T`) 
        with the *entire array* `x` (type `T[]`).
            *   In D, comparing a scalar `T` with an array `T[]` using 
            `!=` or `==` is generally not what you want for element-wise 
            comparison. It will compare pointers and lengths if they are 
            dynamic arrays, or it might not compile depending on `T`. This 
            comparison will almost always be `true` (an element is not the 
            same as the whole array it came from, unless `T` is `T[]` and 
            other very specific conditions hold, which is unlikely here).
        *   `cast(double)x`: This is attempting to cast the *entire array* 
        `x` (type `T[]`) to a single `double`.
            *   This will only compile if `T` is such that `T[]` can be cast 
            to `double`. This is highly unlikely and usually an error. For instance, 
            you can't cast `int[]` to `double`. You might be able to cast `double[]` 
            to `double` if the array has only one element *and* there's an implicit 
            conversion defined, but that's not general. More likely, it's a conceptual 
            error from the original code.
            *   If `T` itself is `double`, then `x` is `double[]`. `cast(double)x` 
            is still trying to cast `double[]` to `double`. This is not a standard 
            conversion.
        *   `a != cast(double)x`: Similar to the first part, comparing an element 
        `a` (type `T`) with the result of `cast(double)x`.
